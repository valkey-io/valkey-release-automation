Description: Persistent key-value database with network interface
 Valkey is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
 structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
 sorted sets.
 .
 You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
 incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
 intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
 ranking in a sorted set.
 .
 In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Valkey works with an
 in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
 by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
 each command to a log.
 .
 Valkey also supports trivial-to-setup primary-replica replication, with very
 fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
 and so forth.
 .
 Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
 limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Valkey behave like
 a cache.
